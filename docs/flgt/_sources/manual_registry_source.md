Gui Registry
============

`fiatlight.fiat_togui` is the central module that is able to associate a GUI with a type.

It uses sophisticated mechanisms to inspect the type of function parameters and return values.

It handles a registry of types and their associated GUIs, to which you can add your own types, by calling`
fiatlight.register_type(DataType, DataTypeWithGui)`, where `DataType` is the type you want to register, and `DataTypeWithGui` is the class that will handle the GUI for this type.

`DataTypeWithGui` must inherit from `AnyDataWithGui` and implement the necessary callbacks.

Explore the registry
=====================

The `fiatlight` command line utility is a powerful tool that allows you to explore the available widgets and types in Fiatlight. It can be used to list the available types, to print the GUI info for a given type, and to run a GUI demo for a given type.

Here is the help message for the `fiatlight` command line utility:

```bash
%%bash
fiatlight --help
```

See the page [Tutorials/fiatlight command line utility](manual_cli.ipynb) for more information.

Primitive types
================

The primitive types `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` are registered by default.

Basic example
-------------

```python
import fiatlight as fl
def foo(a: float, b: float = 3.0, times_two: bool = False) -> float:
    return (a + b) * (2 if times_two else 1)

# Run an app that displays the GUI for the function
# where the user can input the values of the parameters
# (or use the default values)
fl.run(foo, app_name="Primitive Basic")
```

Example with custom GUI options
-------------------------------

The GUI for these primitive types is extensively configurable via fiat attributes. Below, we customize the GUI for the `celsius` parameter to be a slider ranging from 0 to 100, with a specific format for displaying the value.

See [FunctionWithGui](api_function_with_gui) for a comprehensive list of all the available attributes (in the "Customizing parameters GUI" section).

```python
import fiatlight as fl


@fl.with_fiat_attributes(celsius__range=(0, 100), celsius__format="%.1f Â°C")
def to_fahrenheit(celsius: float) -> float:
    return celsius * 9 / 5 + 32


fl.run(to_fahrenheit, app_name="Primitive Custom")
```

Range limited numeric types
----------------------------

As a convenience, Fiatlight includes those predefined types for which the GUI will take into account their boundings.

```python
from typing import NewType

# Float types with specific ranges (bounds included)
Float_0_1 = NewType("Float_0_1", float)  # 0 to 1
Float_0_1.__doc__ = "synonym for float in [0, 1] (NewType)"

Float__1_1 = NewType("Float__1_1", float)  # -1 to 1
Float__1_1.__doc__ = "synonym for float in [-1, 1] (NewType)"

PositiveFloat = NewType("PositiveFloat", float)  # Any positive float ( strictly greater than 0)
PositiveFloat.__doc__ = "synonym for float > 0 (strictly greater than 0) (NewType)"

# Int types with specific ranges (bounds included)
Int_0_255 = NewType("Int_0_255", int)  # 0 to 255
Int_0_255.__doc__ = "synonym for int in [0, 255] (NewType)"
```

File name types
===============

Several file types names are registered by default. They are synonyms for `str` and are used to specify file paths.
They will be presented with a file dialog in the GUI.

```magic
from fiatlight.fiat_notebook import look_at_code
%look_at_python_code fiatlight.fiat_types.file_types
```

Color types
===========

Several color types are registered by default.

```magic
%look_at_python_code fiatlight.fiat_types.color_types
```

*Example: using color types in function*

```python
import fiatlight as fl
from fiatlight.fiat_types import ColorRgb, ColorRgba

def color_chooser(color1: ColorRgba, color2: ColorRgb) -> str:
    return f"You selected: {color1=}, {color2=}"

fl.run(color_chooser, app_name="Color Chooser")
```


Optional types
==============

If a type is registered, its optional version is also registered.

*Example: using an optional color in a function*

(In this example, the user needs to click on "Set" to set a value to the optional color)
```python
import fiatlight as fl
from fiatlight.fiat_types import ColorRgb, ColorRgba

def color_chooser(color: ColorRgb | None = None) -> str:
    return f"You selected: {color=}"

fl.run(color_chooser, app_name="Optional Color")
```


Lists
=====

A very basic support is provided for lists. It does not allow to edit the values.
However, it can present a list of values using (all of them will be rendered as string using str() function).

```python
import fiatlight as fl
from fiatlight.fiat_types import TextPath

def list_words_in_file(filenames: TextPath) -> list[str]:
    with open(filenames) as f:
        return f.read().split()

fl.run(list_words_in_file, app_name="List Words in File")
```


Enum classes
============

Enum classes are automatically associated to a GUI.

```python
import fiatlight as fl
from enum import Enum

class Color(Enum):
    Red = 1
    Green = 2
    Blue = 3

def color_chooser(color: Color) -> str:
    return f"You selected: {color.name}"

fl.run(color_chooser, app_name="Enum Color")
```
