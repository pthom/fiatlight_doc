    "The code for Streamlit was split into two parts: [figures](../fiat_kits/fiat_matplotlib/comparison_streamlit/figure_demo_streamlit.py) and [animated sine wave](../fiat_kits/fiat_matplotlib/comparison_streamlit/anim_wave_streamlit.py).\n",

    "### 2. Performance and Responsiveness\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - Updates at 35 frames per second, providing real-time interactivity.\n",
    "      If using [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) instead of Matplotlib, Fiatlight would reach the artificial limit of 120 FPS.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - Displays at about 2 frames per second. However, no particular effort was made in optimizing streamlit workflow; and better results may be possible (maybe by switching from Matplotlib to Plotly).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Customization and Extensibility\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - Allows deep customization of widgets, including advanced editing types and ranges. Users can define custom widgets and function graphs for extensive flexibility.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - Provides a wide range of built-in widgets and customization options, but may not match Fiatlight’s specialized functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. State Management\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - Automatically saves and restores user inputs, widget placements, and settings. Supports saving different configurations and restoring them later.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - Requires manual handling of state management. Users need to implement custom solutions to save and restore states across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Algorithmic pipelines\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - Supports function graphs, enabling chaining of functions and visualization of their inputs and outputs, simplifying complex workflows.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - Does not natively support function graphs. Users need to manually code function linkages, which can be more cumbersome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. User Experience\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - Offers rich user experience with the ability to resize and move figures, enhancing usability and flexibility.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - Provides a straightforward interface but lacks advanced UI manipulation features like resizing and moving figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Ease of Use and Learning Curve\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - Powerful and flexible but might have a steeper learning curve due to advanced features.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - User-friendly and easy to learn, allowing rapid development and prototyping with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Deployment and Accessibility\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - Fiatlight can run inside a Jupyter Notebook, but requires a local environment and lacks web-based deployment capabilities. Efforts with pyodide are underway but still in development.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - Easily deployable on the web and compatible with platforms like Google Colab, making it accessible from anywhere, which is advantageous for collaboration and sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Community and Support\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - May not have as extensive a community or support resources as Streamlit.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - Large and active community, extensive documentation, and support resources, beneficial for new users and those seeking help or examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Integration with Data Science Tools\n",
    "- **Fiatlight**:\n",
    "    - Can integrate with data science tools but may require more setup and configuration. Its use of Dear ImGui allows for high-performance graphics and interactive applications, which can be beneficial for certain data science applications.\n",
    "- **Streamlit**:\n",
    "    - Well-integrated with popular data science libraries and tools, making it a go-to choice for data scientists and analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Both Fiatlight and Streamlit have their unique advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fiatlight** excels in high-performance applications, offering extensive customization, advanced interactive features, and sophisticated state management that includes automatic saving and restoring of user inputs and widget placements. This makes it exceptionally well-suited for rapid prototyping, as users can quickly iterate on their designs without losing their configurations. Its support for function graphs simplifies complex workflows, making it a powerful tool for developing intricate applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Streamlit** is ideal for users who prioritize ease of use and web-based deployment. It offers a user-friendly interface that facilitates rapid development and prototyping, especially for data-driven applications and dashboards. Its seamless integration with popular data science libraries and web deployment capabilities makes it accessible from anywhere, promoting collaboration and sharing.\n",
